## Building image

These environment variables must be present while building the (executable) docker image using `make build`.

```bash
FROM_ADDR=...
EMAIL_PASSWORD=...
URL=https://www.bigbasket.com/pd/241600/tata-salt--iodized-1-kg-pouch/
```

Also, before building image, `subscribers.json` file is required.
Please note that the `area` string should be exactly as in one of BigBasket's auto-suggestions in the drop down.
Note that `email` can also be a list of strings.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "city": "xyz1",
    "area": "xyz1",
    "email": "xyz1@abc.com"
  },
  {
    "city": "xyz2",
    "area": "xyz2",
    "email": ["xyz2@abc.com", "xyz3@abc.com"]
  }
]
```

## Running the image

make run
```
